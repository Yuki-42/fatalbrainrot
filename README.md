Project Setup Guide
Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

    ImageMagick
        Install manually. For detailed instructions, refer to GeeksforGeeks ImageMagick Guide.

    FFmpeg
        Download and install FFmpeg.

    ChromeDriver
        Ensure you have the version of ChromeDriver that matches your installed version of Chrome.
        To avoid auto-updates:
            Download and install an older version of Chrome.
            Open Chrome to let it update to the latest version.
            After the update completes, go to the app files and delete the files for the new version.
            Chrome should no longer auto-update.
Run componants.py, background.py, and finaledit.py in that order
