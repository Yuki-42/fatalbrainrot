need to install FFmpeg
to use chromedriver you will need to use the corrisponding version of chrome, the easist way ive found was to download and install an old version which will then start downloading the newest version when you open it, let it do that, when its done go into the app files and delete the files for the new version, chrome will nolonger try and update after this
